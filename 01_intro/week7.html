6/29
Program an Arduino board to do something. The examples in the Arduino Projects Book provide good starting points. You may also wish to use this assignment to build on the previous assignment.
Include code snippets in your documentation.
Draw a schematic of your circuit. Use a hand sketch, Flastad, Fusion 360 (Eagle), or other.
Bring your circuit to class Tuesday and be ready to do a brief live demo.
Next week we will talk about 3D printing, and a bit more about 3D modeling. Take a moment to think about your final project proposal. Will it require 3D printed parts?

7/4
Design and print either (a) a component you need for your final project or (b) a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods. Upload your 3D model file (e.g. .f3z), STL file, and sliced gcode file to your documentation. (You can use Download my STL file <\a> to make downloadable links to your files).
Scan something using a photogrammetry application.
Update your website with more information about your final project, including a bill of materials, timeline, and project plan (including whether you'll need 3D printed parts).

7/6
1. Use a sensor from the kit to measure a physical quantity with your microcontroller. Calibrate your sensor (describe the range between its min and max values, and whether you can control this range). Show data in the form of a table or graph.
2. Do the same as (1) with a sensor you have fabricated yourself using copper tape, aluminum foil, Velostat, etc.
7/11
Use an output device that you haven't used before today.
Write a microcontroller program that integrates at least one input device and one output device. Avoid the delay() function and use the C++ class structure.
Use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain at which your output device is operating. Is it on a fixed clock? What's its speed? Share images and describe your findings.
Prepare CAD files for CNC (next class). Consider either 2D DXF files for routing sheet material (like plywood or OSB), or 3D STL files to mill out a (2.5D) shape. We will also cover molding & casting, so you may want to consider milling a mold.

7/13
Design something and make it using CNC. You may use the ShopBot (2D outlines), the Shaper (2D outlines) or the SRM-20 (2.5D molds).
Create something by molding and casting.

7/18
Control a board from a local wireless network. Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. Optionally, work with a partner to control a device over a remote server.
7/20
Make a machine that includes at least one stepper motor. Feel free to use other items in the lab (e.g. string, magnets, wires).
Demonstrate that you calibrate motor position (i.e. guarantee the "home" position is the same each time you power on the device)

7/25
Document progress on your final project. Consolidate your final project updates to a single "process" page. Optionally, create an additional concise "finished product" page. Plan on creating a 1-minute demo video for your final project. Here are some examples.

7/27
We will share our work in a "project fair" format, where everyone will have a chance to present their work to anyone who comes by.
Please have your class website open on a laptop (or other display). Be ready to demo your final project as best you can. Also, include any weekly assignments that you're proud of, especially kinetic sculptures.
Your grade is mostly based on your documentation and scope of work, but also on your presentation, to a lesser extent. Certain anonymous guest critics will be among the crowd, and they will have the chance to tell the teaching staff who they thought had the most impressive projects and presentations.
In addition to being required for the class, project fairs are a great opportunity to meet people and find future opportunities. Don't be shy!
Take some time to see the other projects in the class, but plan to spend most of the two hours by your work.

8/1
[Final Proj.](./nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/20_final/index.html) I dont know how to make a link to an external document. I'll ask about it in lab tommorrow.
