#### Week 2: Pressfits and household objects

 This is an image of the pressfit model I made in fusion 360. This is just one part of it and when I create multiple It will become a construction of a tree without leaves. This press fit construction was created by MIT and I decided that it looked fun to do. My first attempt at printing was a failure due to the fact that I had accidentally scaled the size of the first bit to around 10x what it should have been. After scaling down my first model to 10% of its size I ran into a different problem and that was that the notches were too wide for the cardboard to stay in place. I had used the Calipers to measure the width of the cardboard but had forgotten to account for the extra milimeters the laser would eat away on its own. I had set the gap to be about 3.8mm which was the measured size of the cardboard and the gap ended up being about 4.2mm so the laser at away .5mm of the cardboard.

 The Two 3D household objects that I chose were a dumbell and a lamp. To model these I used a software called Sketch Up because I felt it was easier to use than fusion 360 and I really like how in Sketch up I can change the color or texture of a material. For example: on the grip of the Dumbell I was able to import a picutre to a texture and make it look as though the Dumbell had the grip notches and for the Lamp I was able to color It a Metalic Grey.
