I wanted to make something boring and simple. Its just a swing and instsead of actually swinging it just kinda jerks because nobody is on it and it would be impractical to have it moving a lot without anyone on it.

The Code that I used for the Arduino Board is below: 

const int A1A = 3;  
const int A1B = 4;  

void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(A1A, 0);  
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  
  analogWrite(A1A, 225);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  delay(350);              

  
  analogWrite(A1A, 0);   
  delay(5000);             

 

}
 
 Here are some pictures of the process:

I used my Pressfit Idea and wanted to expand upon it. So I made a tree using the pressfit Idea given to me by MIT. I incorporated a swing attatched to it to account for the kinetic structure.

 ![Picture of Motor](./Motor.png)
This was the mechanism that moved the string to pull it tighter and then release It. if I had more time I would habve done research on the Ideal proportions for that kind of mechanism because I was unable to attatch the string too far to the inside because It would get caught on the motor and wrap around. Also, I had a very faulty motor and It would not move at some points when I tried to change the output. THe minimum output threshold was around 135 when it generally is much lower. I do not know if that was because mine was different or because all of them were faulty. I programmed the arduino to send power to the motor every 5 seconds for 0.45 seconds to create one full revolution. Once again, I ran into a Problem because the Motor when faced with resistance would not consistently provide one full revolution and instead went off inconsistently going 5/8ths of the way one time and 2/5ths of the way another. I had to settle with an inconsitent jerk because I was short on time but aesthetically it was kind of pleasing to look at. I also made a switch which I was very proud of.
