#### Week 1: Introduction 

Here are some of the ideas I had for a final project:


1. An automatic tourniqete

My PLan would be to use a strap of some sort, research the Ideal pressure to stop bleeding and then I would use a pressure sensor connected to an air pocket within the strap that would increase in pressure as the strap would get tighter therefore letting the pressure sensor know when to let the strap tightener to stop tightening. I would Use the 3D printer to rrint out a small platform shell for all of the techinvolved so that the User of the Automatic tourniquette could bring the tourniquette anywhere unlike the ones that currently exist in hospitals. Also, If I would be able to program it, I would INclude a USB port on one side as well as an EKG sensor so that the User could monitor their conition whilst waiting for help to arrive.


2. An automatic/computerized cameraman

This one is a little bit more out there. I am not an experienced coder as you can clearly see so it would be hard for me to develop some sort of tracking software on top of the fact that I cannot imagine what kind of sensor I would use for the detection of the target so that the outside world does not affect the vieography of the cameraman. I drew up a rough draft of what It would look like. The reason I only included 6 sensors was because I would expect that the person taking the video would not need a whole 360 degrees of coverage because at that point you and slap it on a tripod. This is meant to be a cost effective form of gaining better imagery for athlmight as well just buy a 360 degree camera etes who train alone and need to watch their reps without buying a 400$ or 500$ camera.
